Welcome to **OTOmatAGE**, an interactive R Shiny application designed to help you discover the fascinating world of fish otoliths and learn how marine biologists determine the age of fish using artificial intelligence.

---

## üåä About the Project

**Otoliths** are small calcified structures located in the inner ear of fish that act as natural biological recorders. Each year, a new growth layer is deposited, similar to tree rings. By studying these annual rings, scientists can estimate a fish's age and monitor population health.

This application focuses on the **European plaice** (*Pleuronectes platessa*), a common flatfish species in the North Sea and English Channel. Using machine learning, **OTOmatAGE** automatically predicts the age of plaice from otolith images, providing an educational and interactive way to explore marine biology research.

## üéÆ How to Use

1. **üì∏ Load an Otolith Image**: The app randomly selects an otolith from the database
2. **ü§î Make Your Prediction**: Estimate the age (0-7+ years) based on the visible growth rings
3. **ü§ñ Get AI Prediction**: Let the machine learning model analyze the otolith
4. **üìä Compare Results**: See how your estimate compares to the AI prediction and the real age
5. **üîÑ Practice More**: Load another otolith to continue learning and improving

### Understanding the Results

- **Your Prediction**: Your visual estimate based on ring counting
- **AI Prediction**: K-Nearest Neighbors model prediction (k=7)
- **True Age**: The actual age determined by expert readers
- **Accuracy Score**: How close your prediction was to reality

---

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Model

The application uses a **K-Nearest Neighbors (k=7)** algorithm trained on morphological features extracted from otolith images.

### Model Details

- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **K Value**: 7 neighbors
- **Features**: Morphological characteristics from otolith images
- **Age Range**: 0 to 7+ years
- **Training Data**: Expert-validated age readings from plaice otoliths
